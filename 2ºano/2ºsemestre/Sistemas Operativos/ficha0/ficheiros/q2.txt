Three Swords for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne,
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Sword to rule them all, One Sword to find them,
One Sword to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
